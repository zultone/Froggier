# Froggier
This is a fun game for kids. Use arrow keys to catch the flies.


Froggier_game.py, img_assets.py, and background.gif need to be in the same directory, place Music and Assets folders in the same home directory.
This is where img_assets.py will look for images, and the pygame mixer module will look in Music for all audio files.

Left, Right, Up, Down arrow keys and space to play.

Requires PyGame module for sound.
